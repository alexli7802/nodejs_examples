1. Node.js uses asynchronous programming. So requests get served in a very
   responsive way!!
2. Node.js runs a single serving thread, very memory efficient.
3. import a library
    var http = require('http');
4. Node.js built-in modules/libraries
    - HTTP             (http request, http response)
    - URL              (parse query string)
